PREAMBLE 

Introduction 
This preamble explains the purpose of this Zoning By-law and how it should be used. 
The preamble does not form part of the Zoning By-law. It is intended to make the Zoning 
By-law more understandable and easier to reference. 

Purpose of This Zoning By-law 
This Zoning By-law implements the policies of the Town of Ajax Official Plan. The Official 
Plan contains policies that affect the use of land throughout the Town. These policies 
specify where certain land uses are permitted and, in some instances, specify what 
regulations should apply to the development of certain lands. 
The Official Plan is a general document that is not intended to regulate every aspect of 
the built-form on a private lot. In the Province of Ontario, this is the role of the Zoning By-
law. Once an Official Plan is in effect, any Zoning By-law passed by Council must 
conform to the Official Plan. For example, if the Official Plan stated that lands in the 
vicinity of a significant natural feature are to remain in their natural state, the Zoning By-
law would prohibit the erection of buildings or structures on those lands. 
The statutory authority to zone land is granted by the Ontario Planning Act. The Planning 
Act specifies what a By-law can regulate. A Zoning By-law can: 
 

• prohibit the use of land or buildings for any use that is not specifically permitted 
by the By-law; 
 

• prohibit the erection or siting of buildings and structures on a lot except in 
locations permitted by the By-law; 

 
• regulate the type of construction and the height, bulk, location, size, floor area, 

spacing, and use of buildings or structures; 
 

• regulate the minimum frontage and depth of a parcel of land; 
 

• regulate the proportion of a lot that any building or structure may occupy; 
 

• regulate the minimum elevation of doors, windows or other openings in buildings 
or structures; 

 
• require parking and loading facilities be provided and maintained for a purpose 

permitted by the By-law; and, 

 
TOWN OF AJAX ZONING BY-LAW 95-2003 Page i 
Office Consolidation November 1, 2023  



• prohibit the use of lands and the erection of buildings or structures on land that 
is: 

- subject to flooding; 
- the site of steep slopes; 
- rocky, low-lying, marshy or unstable; 
- contaminated; 
- a sensitive groundwater recharge area or head water area; 
- the location of a sensitive aquifer; 
- a significant wildlife habitat area, wetland, woodland, ravine, valley or 

area of natural and scientific interest; 
- a significant natural corridor or shoreline of a lake, river or stream; or, 
- the site of a significant archaeological resource. 

How to Use This By-law 
To reference this By-law each of the steps listed below should be followed to determine 
what permissions apply to a particular property. 

1. Locate the Property on a Map 
 Maps in a Zoning By-law are referred to as 'Schedules'. The first step to using this By-

law is to refer to the zone schedules that are contained at the back of the By-law to 
determine in which zone category the subject property is located. The zone category 
will be indicated on the schedules by a symbol or abbreviation. For example, a 
symbol such as “R1-A" beside a property would indicate that the property is within the 
'Residential Type 1 Zone'. The zone symbols or abbreviations used in this By-law are 
explained on the first page of Section 2 of the By-law or contact Ajax Planning and 
Development Services for assistance.  

 Section 2 also provides assistance to help identify the zone boundaries on the 
Schedules. For example, if a property appears close to a zone boundary refer to 
section 2.4 of the By-law. 
2. By-law Amendments 
A Zoning By-law is not a static document; it is amended over time as development 
proceeds and policies governing land use change. Before proceeding any further, 
verify that the property is not the subject of an earlier Zoning By-law amendment, 
Minister’s Zoning Order or a minor variance. Zoning By-law amendments are listed in 
Section 7 of this By-law and Minister’s Zoning Orders are listed in Section 9 of this 
By-law. More recent amendments may not be included in this version of the By-law. 
A minor variance does not amend the Zoning By-law. It simply excuses a property 
from a specific requirement of the Zoning By-law (such as a minimum side yard 
setback) if the use and structures on the property conforms to all other aspects of the 
By-law. A minor variance is achieved by submitting an application to the Committee of 
Adjustment and allows the property owner to obtain a building permit. Minor variances 
granted by the Committee of Adjustment are not included in this By-law. 

 Staff in the Town's Planning and Development Services department will be able to 
confirm if the property has been subject to a more recent Zoning By-law amendment, 
Minister’s Zoning Order or a minor variance.

3. Permitted Uses 
 Section 6 of the By-law identifies the permitted uses permitted in each zone category 

within the Town. Definitions for these uses are provided in Section 3. Words that are 
defined in Section 3 are italicized throughout the By-law. Uses which are not identified 
as permitted uses within a particular zone are not permitted in that zone. 
4. Zone Standards 

 Section 6 of the By-law also identifies the zone standards that apply to the uses on a 
property for each zone in the Town. Standards that typically apply to permitted uses 
include minimum lot area, minimum frontage requirements, minimum yard 
requirements, maximum lot coverage for buildings; maximum permitted height of 
buildings and in some cases, the minimum required landscaped open space on the 
lot. In some cases, there may be additional standards beyond those identified in this 
Preamble. 
5. General Provisions 

 Section 4 of this By-law provides a more generic set of standards known as 'General 
Provisions' that apply to all properties in all zones throughout the Town unless 
otherwise specifically governed by zone standards or exceptions referred to 
elsewhere in the By-law. For example, the General Provisions include standards to 
regulate the construction and location of accessory buildings. These standards apply 
to all properties regardless of where in the Municipality the property is located. 
6. Parking and Loading 

 There is one final section of the By-law that should be consulted when determining 
what permissions apply to a specific property. Section 5 provides the parking and 
loading requirements for all permitted uses in the Town. 
7. Explanatory Notes 

 A series of drawings are provided in the back of this document to assist the reader in 
interpreting certain Zoning By-law provisions. These drawings are for illustration 
purposes only and do not form part of the actual By-law.  
Description of By-law Components 

This By-law contains nine sections which together, provide the zoning standards 
applicable to all lands within the Town of Ajax. These sections are as follows: 

• Section 1 – Interpretation and Administration 
• Section 2 – Establishment of Zones 
• Section 3 – Definitions 
• Section 4 – General Provisions 
• Section 5 – Parking, Loading and Queuing Requirements 
• Section 6 – Zone Provisions 
• Section 7 – Exceptions 
• Section 8 – Holding Provisions, Temporary Use Zones, and Interim Control Zones 
• Section 9 – Minister’s Zoning Orders 
• Section 10 – Enactment 

 

 
TOWN OF AJAX ZONING BY-LAW 95-2003 Page iii 
Office Consolidation November 1, 2023  



The purpose of each of these sections is described below. 
Section 1 – Interpretation and Administration 
This Section specifies: 

• the lands that are subject to this By-law; 
• that every parcel of land governed by this By-law is to conform and comply 

with the By-law; and, 
• the penalties to be levied against a person or a corporation for 

contravention of any provision in the By-law. 
Section 2 - Establishment of Zones 
This Section establishes the zones that apply to the lands governed by this By-law. This 
Section also describes how to determine the location of the Zone boundaries on the 
schedules. 
Section 3 - Definitions 
It is necessary to define words in a Zoning By-law because it is a legal document which, 
if necessary, can be enforced in a court of law. These definitions are intended to clarify 
the intent of the By-law and ensure that the By-law is interpreted consistently. 
Section 4 - General Provisions 
This Section contains regulations that apply to certain types of uses, buildings or 
structures regardless of where in the municipality or in what zone they are located. For 
example, this Section contains provisions dealing with the construction of accessory 
buildings in any zone or provisions to regulate the operation of home based businesses.  
Section 5 – Parking, Loading, and Queuing Requirements 
Parking and loading facilities are required for almost all permitted uses. This Section 
establishes requirements for parking and loading facilities including such regulations as 
the number of spaces required for permitted uses, minimum driveway width, minimum 
parking space size and the location of parking facilities on a lot. 
Section 6 – Zone Provisions 
This Section lists the uses permitted within each Zone. The effect is to only permit 
certain uses in specified locations within the Town. The only uses permitted in a zone 
are those that are specified in the By-law. If a use is not specifically identified as a 
permitted use then it is not permitted. Similarly, if a use is defined in Section 6 of the By-
law but does not appear as a permitted use in any zone, then it is not a use permitted 
within any Zone. 
This Section also contains regulations that control the placement, bulk and height of a 
building on a lot. This includes regulations such as minimum lot size, minimum frontage, 
maximum building height or the maximum coverage of a building on a lot. 
Section 7 – Exceptions 
This Section contains regulations applicable to one property or a specific group of 
properties in the Town. Exceptions are denoted on the Exceptions Schedules by a bold 
outline and a numeric reference which guides the reader to the applicable Section of the 
By-law.

when it was passed by Council in accordance with Section 34 of the Planning Act, 
R.S.O. 1990.

corners of the nearest adjacent principal buildings on either side of the subject lot: the mid point of the proposed front 
building wall shall intersect with this line, with a permitted deviation toward the front or rear of the lot of up to 1.5 
metres. For all corner lots, the setback shall either match to within 1.5 metres of the established setback of any 
designated or heritage “wish list” building existing on the lot, or alternatively, be determined by drawing a line parallel 
to and even with the least point of setback of the street-facing wall of the nearest principal building adjacent to the 
interior side lot line of the subject lot, with a permitted deviation toward the front or rear of the lot of up to 1.5 metres. In

2) No more that 8 ground level dwelling units shall be attached side-by-side along the width of the dwelling, and in no instances 
shall the width of the dwelling between the opposing outer side walls of the end units be more than 52.0 metres. 

3) A minimum dwelling unit width of 5.48 metres applies in all instances where a private garage is attached to the front of the 
dwelling unit; however, the dwelling unit width may be reduced to a minimum of 4.4 metres for a particular unit where the 
garage is located in and/or has a vehicle door facing the yard opposite the front yard and is accessed by a public street or 
lane abutting the same yard, or where parking is provided in a common parking area. 

4) The specified minimum amount of built frontage along any given block face relates to building walls located inside a build-
within zone. 

5) The specified minimum amount of built frontage may be reduced to 50% for any portion of the block face consisting of a lot 
where the building wall within the build-within zone is an exterior side wall of a triplex, double duplex, linked villa, street 
townhouse, maisonette, live-work unit, block townhouse, or stacked townhouse dwelling.    

6) A minimum two-thirds (67) of the length of both the front and exterior side walls of a building shall be located within the 
prescribed range of the build-within zone; the remaining third (33%) may be further setback from the street edge. In the case 
of a corner lot, a portion of the junction of the front and exterior side walls (i.e., the building “corner”) shall be built within 0.6 – 
3.0 metres of the daylighting triangle/corner rounding. The one exception to the build-within requirement abutting a daylighting 
triangle/corner rounding shall be in the event that the street corner of the lot is developed for the purposes of an urban 
square, in which case at least 70% of that part of the perimeter of the urban square which is not adjacent to a street edge or 
sight triangle shall abut a building façade. Public utility buildings are not subject to any build-within provisions.

7) Where the range is shown as “x-y”, x is the minimum yard setback, y is the maximum yard setback, and no parking space in 
the yard or private garage door facing onto the yard shall be permitted. Where the range is shown as “x-y/z”, x is the 
minimum yard setback, y is the maximum yard setback in instances where no parking space in the yard or private garage 
vehicle door facing onto the yard is proposed, and z is the maximum front yard setback in instances where a parking space in 
the front yard or private garage vehicle door facing onto the front yard is proposed. In all instances, where a private garage 
vehicle door is proposed facing onto the front yard, the vehicle door face shall not be setback from the front lot line 1.5 metres 
more than the value of z, nor shall a private garage project beyond the front face of the dwelling unit. 

Notwithstanding any other requirement of this by-law, all dwelling units designed as double front units shall have a maximum 
front yard setback of 3.5 metres and a maximum exterior side yard setback of 3.5 metres. 

The build-within zone does not apply to buildings which by physical necessity are located in the interior of a block and 
adjacent only to a private road, lane or driveway, or to accessory buildings or structures. 

Notwithstanding any other requirements of this By-law, the prescribed setbacks for a build-within zone may be measured from 
the front face of an attached porch, subject to the following: 
i) the depth of the attached front or exterior side porch shall not be less than 1.5 metres and no more than 3.0 metres, 

measured from the front face or exterior side face of the building to the front face of the porch; 
ii) the minimum width of the attached front or exterior side porch shall not be less than the following, whichever is less: 

a) 3.0 metres; or 
b) if the porch faces the front yard, the entire width of the habitable portion of the building, measured from the 

nearest exterior wall of any attached private garage to the opposite side wall of the building. 
iii) the front face of an attached porch may encroach to within a minimum of 1.5 metres from a front or exterior side lot 

line, and still be considered to comply with the build-within zone requirements. 
8) Plus 0.3 metres extra for each additional 1.0 metre of building height in excess of 12.0 metres. 
9) No side yards are required abutting a side lot line that coincides with the vertical party wall between two dwelling units. 
10) The rear yard shall be half the height of the building from a minimum of 9.0 metres up to a maximum of 15.0 metres. 
11) In instances where more than one-third of the units, in a dwelling are located on a through lot or on a lot abutting a public 

street on one side and an Open Space Zone on the opposite side, the dwelling shall be designed such that all units are 
double front units, and there is no rear yard as defined in Section 3. For double front units on a through lot, the front yard shall

be the yard facing the public street having the greater right-of-way width or, if the rights-of-way are equal, the yard without a 
parking space in the yard or private garage vehicle door 
facing onto the yard. For double front units on a lot abutting a public street on one side and an Open Space Zone on the 
opposite side, the front yard shall be the yard facing abutting the Open Space Zone. In both instances, the yard located 
opposite the yard deemed to be the front yard shall have a minimum depth of 3.0 metres, although a porch may further 
encroach a maximum of 1.5 metres into the yard. 

12) Notwithstanding any other provision of this By-law, where the principal use of a property is a Parking Lot, a maximum of 75% 
of the site may be used for parking, aisles and driveways, provided that all applicable landscaping and buffer requirements of 
this By-law are maintained. 

13) Where the apartment dwelling is a senior citizen’s apartment building, up to 550 units per net hectare may be permitted. 
14) Notwithstanding the minimum height requirements specified for any Downtown Central Area Zone, where a development site 

includes an area designated in the Ajax Official Plan as a “Gateway Site”, the minimum height requirements specified in 
Section 6.9.3 shall apply. 

15) A residential mixed-use building shall have a minimum height of 3 storeys. 
16) For single-use residential dwellings adjacent to Harwood Avenue South or Bayly Street, the minimum height shall be 3 

storeys. 
17) This regulation applies only to buildings adjacent to designated arterial and collector roads. 

 
6.9.2.1 Interim Non-Compliance with Respect to Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density Requirements 
i) Extensions/Expansions of Existing Non-Complying Development 

Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density requirements within Section 6.9.2, extensions or 
expansions of existing non-complying development (namely, additions to existing buildings or the development 
of new buildings on the same site as existing development) on development sites larger than 2.0 hectares shall 
be permitted without amendment to the Zoning By-law with respect to the provisions regulating Built Frontage, 
Lot Coverage and Density, provided that: 
a) the intent of the Official Plan is not compromised and the tests prescribed in Section 2.4.2.1 m) of the 

Official Plan are met; and, 

  
TOWN OF AJAX ZONING BY-LAW 95-2003                                                                                         Page 103

b) the building extension or expansion is designed and sited in a manner which demonstrates, to the 
satisfaction of the Town, that the development of the site is moving toward a greater level of 
compliance with all applicable regulations of this By-law, and does not preclude or hinder the ability to 
ultimately achieve compliance. In this regard, a Master Concept Development Plan demonstrating 
compliance under ultimate build-out conditions shall be submitted for approval by the Town. This plan 
shall demonstrate that the proposed building extension or expansion shall protect for the ability of 
progressive intensification on the site to ultimately achieve compliance. It is understood that the Master 
Concept Development Plan may be amended from time-to-time, in response to the vagaries of the 
market, but all such amendments shall continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s satisfaction, the ability to 
ultimately achieve compliance in a fashion which maintains the intent of the Official Plan and the 
requirements of the Zoning By-law.  

ii) Phasing of New Development on Vacant Sites 
Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density requirements within Section 6.9.2, it is 
understood that the development of any given property may involve a number of phases before it achieves 
ultimate build-out. As a result, the density, built frontage and lot coverage provisions contained in this By-law 
might only be achieved upon the completion of all phases, rather than on a phase-by-phase basis. 
Accordingly, in instances where a development on a vacant site larger than 1.0 hectare is proposed to be 
phased, building phases which individually do not comply with the built frontage, lot coverage and/or density 
provisions of Section 6.9.2 of this By-law shall be permitted without amendment to the Zoning by-law with 
respect to the provisions regulating Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density, provided that a Master Concept 
Development Plan demonstrating compliance under ultimate build-out conditions is submitted and approved by 
the Town. Each phase of development undertaken by the proponent shall protect for future phases in 
accordance with the Master Concept Development Plan, and in no instances will the amount of surface parking 
provided on-site in conjunction with a particular phase exceed maximum coverage restrictions. The phasing of 
development in accordance with the approved Master Concept Development Plan shall be a requirement of 
any related Site Plan Agreement 
It is understood that the Master Concept Development Plan may be amended from time-to-time, in response to 
the vagaries of the market, but all such amendments shall continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s satisfaction, 
the ability to ultimately achieve compliance in a fashion which maintains the intent of the Official Plan and the 
requirements of the Zoning By-law.

 d)   Interim Non-Compliance With Respect to Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and 
Density (FSI) Requirements: 

  i) Ext ensions/Expansions of Existing Non-Complying Development 
Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density (FSI) 
requirements within sub-section (v) above, extensions or expansions of 
existing non-complying development (namely, additions to existing 
buildings or the development of new buildings on the same site as 
existing development) on development sites larger than 2.0 hectares 
shall be permitted without amendment to the Zoning By-law with respect 
to the provisions regulating Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density 
(FSI), provided that: 

  -  The intent of the Official Plan is met; and 
  -  The building extension or expansion is designed and sited in a 

manner which demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Town, that 
the development of the site is moving toward a greater level of 
compliance with all applicable regulations of this By-law, and does 
not preclude or hinder the ability to ultimately achieve compliance. 
In this regard, a Master Concept Development Plan demonstrating 
compliance under ultimate build-out conditions shall be submitted 
for approval by the Town. This plan shall demonstrate that the 
proposed extension or expansion shall protect for the ability of 
progressive intensification on the site to ultimately achieve 
Compliance. It is understood that the Master Concept 
Development Plan may be amended from time-to-time, in 
response to the vagaries of the market, but all such amendments 
shall continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s satisfaction, the 
ability to ultimately achieve compliance in a fashion which

the Zoning By-law.

  ii) Pha sing of New Development on Vacant Sites: 
Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density (FSI) 
requirements within sub-section (v) above, it is understood that the 
development of any given property may involve a number of phases before it 
achieves ultimate build-out. As a result, the density (FSI), built frontage and 
lot coverage provisions contained in this By-Law might only be achieved upon 
the completion of all phases, rather than on a phase-by-phase basis. 
Accordingly, in instances where a development on a vacant site larger than 
2.0 hectares is proposed to be phased, building phases which individually do 
not comply with the built frontage, lot coverage and/or density (FSI) provision 
of sub-section (v) above shall be permitted without amendment to the Zoning 
By-law with respect to the provisions regulating Built Frontage, Lot Coverage 
and Density (FSI), provided that a Master Concept Development Plan 
demonstrating compliance under ultimate build-out conditions is submitted 
and approved by the Town. Each phase of development undertaken by the 
proponent shall protect for future phases in accordance with the Master 
Concept Development Plan. The phasing of development in accordance with 
the approved Master Concept Development Plan shall be a requirement of 
any related Site Plan Agreement. 
It is understood that the Master Concept Plan may be amended from time-to-
time, in response to the vagaries of the market, but all such amendments 
shall continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s satisfaction, the ability to 
ultimately achieve compliance in a fashion which maintains the intent of the 
Official Plan and the requirements of the Zoning By-law.

  (1) Extensions/Expansions of Existing Non-Complying Development 
Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density (FSI) 
requirements within sub-section (v) above, extensions or expansions of 
existing non-complying development (namely, additions to existing 
buildings or the development of new buildings on the same site as 
existing development) on development sites larger than 2.0 hectares 
shall be permitted without amendment to the Zoning By-law with 
respect to the provisions regulating Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and 

 Density (FSI), provided that: 
  i ) The intent of the Official Plan is met; and 

 i i) The building extension or expansion is designed and sited in a 
manner which demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Town, that 
the development of the site is moving toward a greater level of 
compliance with all applicable regulations of this By-law, and does 
not preclude or hinder the ability to ultimately achieve compliance. 
In this regard, a Master Concept Development Plan demonstrating 
compliance under by the Town. This plan shall demonstrate that 
the proposed building extension or expansion shall protect for the 
ability of a progressive intensification on the site to ultimately 
achieve compliance. It is understood that the Master Concept 
Development Plan may be amended from time-to-time, in response 
to the vagaries of the market, but all such amendments shall 
continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s satisfaction; the ability to 
ultimately achieve compliance in a fashion which maintains the 
intent of the Official Plan and the requirements of the Zoning By-

 law 
 (2) Phasing of New Development on Vacant Sites: 

Notwithstanding the Built Frontage, Lot Coverage and Density (FSI) 
requirements within sub-section (v) above, it is understood that the 
development of any given property may involve a number of phases 
before it achieves ultimate build-out. As a result, the density (FSI), built 
frontage and lot coverage provisions contained in this By-Law might 
only be achieved upon the completion of all phases, rather than on a 

 phase-by-phase basis.

   (1) Th e intent of the Official Plan is met; and, 
   (2) The building extension or expansion is designed and sited in a 

manner which demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Town, that 
the development of the site is moving toward a greater level of 
compliance with all applicable regulations of this By-law, and 
does not preclude or hinder the ability to ultimately achieve 
compliance. In this regard, a Master Concept Development Plan 
demonstrating compliance under ultimate build-out conditions 
shall be submitted for approval by the Town. This plan shall 
demonstrate that the proposed building extension or expansion 
shall protect for the ability of progressive intensification on the 
site to ultimately achieve compliance. It is understood that the 
Master Concept Development Plan may be amended from time-
to-time, in response to the vagaries of the market, but all such 
amendments shall continue to demonstrate, to the Town’s

on a phase-by-phase basis. 
Accordingly, in instances where a development on a vacant site larger 
than 2.0 hectares is proposed to be phased, building phases which 
individually do not comply with the built frontage, lot coverage and/or 
density (FSI) provision of sub-section (v) above shall be permitted
